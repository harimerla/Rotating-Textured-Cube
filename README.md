# WebGPU Webpack Starter

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo run

```
npm install
```

To install webpack, then you can run the serve task and point your browser to `localhost:8080`:

```
npm run serve
```

Where you should see the page shown below.

To deploy your application, run:

```
npm run deploy
```

Then you can copy the content of the `dist/` directory to your webserver. You can build a development
distribution by running `npm run build`.

If everything's working you should see this page in your browser when you run the application:
